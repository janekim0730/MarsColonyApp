# Mars Colony App

## Summary
<p>https://marscolony-angular.firebaseapp.com<p>
<p>It is a mobile-first app that lets Colonists report alien encounters on Mars. This app uses Angular Http
service to GET and POST to the API. The users can enter their information as a Colonist, choose a job, 
view previous report results from other colonists and submit a new encounter.</p>

## Languages and Tools Used
<ul>
<li>Angular 2</li>
<li>Angular 2 CLI (Broccoli)</li>
<li>CSS/SASS</li>
<li>Typescript(ES6)</li>
<li>Node JS</li>
<li>WP REST API v2</li>
<li>Postman</li>
<li>Git/Github</li>
<li>Firebase</li>
</ul>

## Experience
<p>I enjoyed learning Angular 2 as it allows pulling the data from API and also posting. Using Postman was also a great 
experience as it displays the API's objects and arrays in easier format. Even though there were less documentations than
the previous Angular, it had great resources.</p>
